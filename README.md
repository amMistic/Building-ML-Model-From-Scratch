# **ML Models From Scratch**

In an era where trends like Neural Networks, NLP, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) dominate, building a strong foundation in core machine learning concepts is more important than ever. This series is dedicated to creating some of the most common and widely used machine learning models **from scratch**. 

Each implementation is designed to be simple, clean, and easy to understand, making it ideal for learning and practical use. I hope you find it helpful! ðŸ˜Š

## **Models Implemented**
1. **Linear Regression**  
2. **Logistic Regression**  
3. **Decision Tree**
4. **Random Forest**
5. **K Nearest Neighbors**

## **Installation and Setup**
### **Step 1: Install Required Libraries**
Before running the models, make sure to install the required dependencies.  
Run the following command:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## **Usage**
### **Step 1: Navigate to the Model Directory**  
Each model is placed in its own directory. Navigate to the respective directory to execute the model.  
```bash
cd <model_directory_name>
```

**Example:**  
```bash
cd 01_Linear_Regression
```

### **Step 2: Run the Training Script**  
After navigating to the model directory, execute the `train.py` file to train the model.  
```bash
python train.py
```
